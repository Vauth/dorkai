# DorkAI - AI Powered Dorker
A web application that uses the Google Gemini API to generate Google Dorks from natural language input. The tool is designed for security professionals, researchers, and developers who utilize advanced search techniques for reconnaissance and open-source intelligence (OSINT).

<br>

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to set up and run a local instance of the application.

### Prerequisites
A Google Gemini API key is required for the application to function.

1.  Navigate to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Generate a new API key.
3.  Copy the key for use in the application.

### Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/vauth/dorkai.git
```
- Navigate into the project directory:
```sh
cd dorkai
```
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. For optimal performance and to prevent potential browser security restrictions, it is recommended to serve the files from a local web server (e.g., Python's `http.server` or the VS Code Live Server extension).
